# StateMachine
This automata was implemented using Python and uses set theory language and logic concepts to complete the desired task. The program reads from a file with a format consisting of a tuple. If the program encounters an empty tuple, the user will be asked to input the name of the file they want to use, and then a string to test with the program. On compile, the program will return a message of either “accepted” or “rejected” depending on the string the user has input.
